Question 1: Use the "http" module for the questions below  

  Create two modules called my "randomNumber" and "myWebServer". The randomNumber module has a function called random(). The random function just returns a random number when it gets executed. 
    
    a. Inside of your myWebServer module, create a web server which listens to requests on port 1234.  
      - Send a request to port 1234 and double check if the browser is expecting a response 

    b. Inside of your myWebServer module, write your request listener function as a callback inside of the server you created above. 
      - This function should return a text message called "Request received and processed" to the browser. 

    c. Import your "randomNumber" module inside of your "myWebServer" module. Generate a random number using that function and return the generated number to the client browser when request is sent to port 1234. 

    d. Create a new folder called "static" inside of your project. Add the Apple html clone inside of this folder. Add a sample "about.html" page inside of your Apple clone folder.
      - Modify your request listener function in a way it would serve the "about.html" page when users request it on the browser. 

      - Modify your listener function in a way that it serves any of the pages inside of your "static" folder when requested.
