Question 1: 
  Create a MySql database by the name "myDB". Create a database user by the name "myDBuser" with permissions to connect with the "myDB" database. 

  Use the "mysql" module to create a connection with the newly created database. Display a console message if the connection is successful or has an error. 

Question 2:   
  Below is a link that contains the tables we need to create to convert the apple.com/iphones page into a dynamic page with a database. 

    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z0lIIymTkTpBn0gfdPQ4Fq8i5OtgGQ3Cc6ZeBKxPgk4/edit#gid=0

  As you can see on the link, there are 5 tables that are needed. 

  Write a SQL query to create the tables inside of the database you created above. Once you write the queries, use the "mysql" module to execute the queries on the database. 

    Try these both methods to initiate the execution of the queries. 
      1. Include it directly on a module to be executed as we initiate the app. (node app.js)

      2. Use the express module to receive requests. Configure your module in a way it will execute the queries when the "/install" url is visited. 

Question 3: 
  Create an HTML page with a form to populate the "products" table you created above. 
    1. The form on the page should send a post request to a url named "add-product". 
    2. Use express to receive the post request 
    3. Use body-parser module to parse the post request sent to express 
    4. Write a SQL query to insert the data received from the form into the "products" table
